The Web Security Scanner is a comprehensive tool designed to identify and assess security vulnerabilities in web applications. By crawling the target website, it systematically examines potential weaknesses such as SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, and other common security issues. Utilizing tools like SQLmap and custom payloads, it performs in-depth scans and generates a detailed PDF report highlighting discovered vulnerabilities. This project leverages concurrent processing to efficiently handle multiple links and provides a practical solution for web security assessments.
